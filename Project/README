Prototype Assembly Instructions.

In order to assemble the prototype, you will need the following:
-	Raspberry Pi (version 3 B+ was used)
-	Arduino Uno
-	DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor (I used the three pin version)
-	A Breadboard
-	An LED
-	8 Male-to-Male connection wires
-	3 Male-to-Female connection wires

Additionally, the following Libraries should be installed on each device:
-	Raspberry Pi
   -	Tkinter – Library to create User Interface.
   -	Smbus – Library to deal with I2C connections.
   -	Threading (should be installed by default)
-	Arduino Uno
   -	Wire.h – Library to deal with I2C connections.
   -	Dht.h – Library to interface with Temperature sensor.

To wire the system together, follow the Wiring Diagram within the Repository.

After wiring the system together and installing all of the relevant libraries for each system, 
load in the program code on each system, and then run the Arduino code first. 
After about 10 seconds, then run the Raspberry Pi program and the User Interface should pop up.
